# Password-Manager
Password Manager - a program built using Python and libraries such as JSON, TKINTER. It allows you to enter pages, e-mail and passwords into the program, and saves them in a separate JSON file. The program also allows you to generate a random strong password. In addition, when we do not remember what the password is for a specific page, which we have already entered, it shows it to us.
